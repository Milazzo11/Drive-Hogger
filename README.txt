This is a prank "virus" that will silently fill up a computer with lots of data.
The Python script will continue to copy the data.txt into the hidden "slowfiles" folder.

The current program allows users to enter the amount of data they wish to fill and execute the program,
however it is quite easily edited to bypass user input and run indefinitely.

The data.txt file is a copy of the Bee Movie script, and I claim no rights to this.  The contents of this file
can be changed, however the multiplier on line 24 must also be changed for the MB data count to be correctly recorded.
